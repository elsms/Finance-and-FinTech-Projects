Based on the heatmap above, four noticeable correlations can be observed.
* a 0.86 (strong positive) correlation between the current cryptocurrency price (in USD) and the market capitalization (in USD).
* a 0.58 (moderately strong positive) correaltion between the news sentiment score and the social sentiment score.
* a 0.66 (moderately strong positive) correlation between the fear & greed index and the social sentiment score.
* a 0.30 (weak positive) correlation between the prediction confidence and the news impact score.
