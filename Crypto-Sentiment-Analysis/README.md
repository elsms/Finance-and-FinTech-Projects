# Introduction 




# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

First, a correlation heatmap was used to explore the Pearson correlation between the dataset's numerical features. <img width="800" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc25bfe3-8d8f-4b3a-aeae-14abc01eb4cb" />

Based on the heatmap above, four noticeable correlations can be observed.
* a 0.86 (strong positive) correlation between the current cryptocurrency price (in USD) and the market capitalization (in USD).
* a 0.58 (moderately strong positive) correaltion between the news sentiment score and the social sentiment score.
* a 0.66 (moderately strong positive) correlation between the fear & greed index and the social sentiment score.
* a 0.30 (weak positive) correlation between the prediction confidence and the news impact score.

After having plotted some bar plots, few considerations can be made. 
* Cardano displayed the highest 24-hour trading volume, followed by Bitcoin and Cosmos. <img width="630" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b29213-174c-4b3c-8bc8-ef83827aa112" />
* Chainlink was the most mentioned cryptocurrency on social media, followed by Cardano. <img width="630" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df947b1e-70f0-41ec-a8d1-15e45acea66e" />
* Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency to reach the highest fear & greed index score of 100 during the observed time frame. <img width="630" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61405c71-f197-47fa-9108-b5f7a1c6fc29" />
