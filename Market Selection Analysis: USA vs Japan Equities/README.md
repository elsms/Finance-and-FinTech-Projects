This preliminary exploratory analysis aims to identify which market to focus on for the *Investments* module project of my MSc at Henley Business School, University of Reading.

## Overview
The analysis compares the USA and Japanese markets using their main industry indeces (S&P 500 and Nikkei 225) and historical trends, key financial ratios and relevant macroeconomic indicators.


## Data 


## Methodology 

## Key findings 

### Indexes Comparison: Nikkei 225 vs S&P 500

### Volume & Market Cap 
Japan’s market has shown consistently a higher trading volume from 2007 to 2025. During the Covid19 period, the two markets‘ trading volumes nearly converged, but Japan started its recovery in 2022. This typically suggests that Japan’s market is more active and liquid. (PIC)

The USA, on the other hand, presents a higher total market capitalization. This indicates that USA-listed companies are more valuable overall, also reflected in the valuation difference between S&P 500 and Nikkei 225. Interestingly, Japan has a higher average market capitalization, suggesting that market value is more evenly distributed across Japanese companies. This indicates that, on average, each Japanese company is worth more than the 'typical' USA company.

## How to run the code 

## Conclusion 

Japan is a more liquid and active market and companies are larger on average, which might attract short-term or frequent traders. The USA, on the other hand, is a bigger market overall, but dominated by a few extremely large corporations and may be preferred by long-term investors.
