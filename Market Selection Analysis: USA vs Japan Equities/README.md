This preliminary exploratory analysis aims to identify which market to focus on for the *Investments* module project of my MSc at Henley Business School, University of Reading.

## Overview
The analysis compares the USA and Japanese markets using their main industry indeces (S&P 500 and Nikkei 225) and historical trends, key financial ratios and relevant macroeconomic indicators.


## Data 


## Methodology 

## Key findings 

### Indexes Comparison: Nikkei 225 vs S&P 500

### Volume & Market Cap 
Japan’s market has shown consistently a higher trading volume from 2007 to 2025. During the Covid-19 period, the two markets‘ trading volumes nearly converged, but Japan started its recovery in 2022. This typically suggests that Japan’s market is more active and liquid. (PIC)

The USA, on the other hand, presents a higher total market capitalization. This indicates that USA-listed companies are more valuable overall, also reflected in the valuation difference between S&P 500 and Nikkei 225. Interestingly, Japan has a higher average market capitalization, suggesting that market value is more evenly distributed across Japanese companies. This indicates that, on average, each Japanese company is worth more than the 'typical' USA company.

### Profitability

The USA outperforms Japan in terms of gross margin, EBITDA, and operating margin, indicating that its companies are generally more profitable at both the operational and core business levels.

USA’s return on assets (ROA) has been increasing since 2020, whereas Japan’s ROA dropped during the pandemic but has rebounded sharply since 2023, almost reaching its peak in 2018. This indicates a strong recovery in asset efficiency. In addition, the USA leads in terms of return on equity (ROE) and return on capital (ROC) as well, suggesting that its companies generate more profit relative to shareholder equity and invested capital and are more effective at turning capital into returns, which may attract long-term investors. 

Finally, the dividend payout ratio (DPR) has been fluctuating for both markets, possibly due to varying corporate policies or economic conditions.

## Conclusion 

Japan is a more liquid and active market and companies are larger on average, which might attract short-term or growth-oriented investors. The USA, on the other hand, is a bigger market overall, but dominated by a few extremely large corporations and may be preferred by long-term investors. In addition, the USA may be more appealing for investors seeking stability and higher returns.
